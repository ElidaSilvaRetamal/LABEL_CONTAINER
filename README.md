### LABEL_CONTAINER
ID_FUNCTION

### Instruction
1. This activity builds on the code you wrote for the first milestone, which shows an apparent inconsistency in the 
behavior of Python variables.

    - The key in this activity will be to use the id() function to compare the unique ID numbers of all the variables
    as you create and change them.

2. Write code to try to prove whether the container model or the label model best describes the behavior of variables
in Python. Again, using the id() function is key.

3. State your understanding of how Python variables work in a few sentences.

4. Variable types: int, float, string, list, tuple and dictionary
